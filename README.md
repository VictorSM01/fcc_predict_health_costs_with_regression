This repository contains my solution to the FreeCodeCamp challenge 'Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator'.  

In this challenge, I predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.  

I was given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. I used the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.
